# Notes Test Task
```
You need to develop a single-page application by using React/Redux javascript frameworks: a text editor for notes with twitter-style tags support.

Main application features:
Create, edit and delete notes. Also, filtering notes by tags.
While adding/editing note, the user should have an option to create a tag using # symbol.

Example:
User enters texts "I wanna go #shop" and during or at the end of the input appropriate tag should be created and displayed.
You can use client or server-side data storage of your choice.
UI design is not important.
The project should be uploaded to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

Will be a plus:
test code coverage
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
